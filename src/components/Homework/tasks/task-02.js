//MORE WITH PROPERTIES
//Task 2 solution is, instead of an Element, an object containing an Element and 'helper' function. Have the Element take in a function as a property and something else for that function to consume to then display in the element

//Style to your hearts content
const Solution = () => {
  return <>your solution...</>;
};

//And Render Them
const Render = () => {
  return <Solution />;
};

//leave code below alone
const solution = {
